The Dipforge project
====================

Dipforge is an Open-Source Java Application Server, that specializes in Enterprise RAD(Rapid Application Development), we do for Enterprise Development what Ruby on Rails did for applications, make it quick and easy. Further more Dipforge is based on a daemon framework similar to OSGI, which makes it possible for Daemons and j2ee applications to interact seamlessly.

The Enterprise RAD framework provided by Dipforge is implemented using a Model Driven approach that is coupled with an ESB(Enterprise Service Bus). This means that all changes to the data Model information are pushed through the ESB and dramatical simplifies integration and interoperability between systems. Because of this approach it is very simply to implement an Enterprise Canonical Model using Dipforge and as the system is dynamic changes to the model are none braking and can be made at any stage.
