UMLCanvas is an implementation around the HTML5 Canvas that allows
generation of UML diagrams. A Mediawiki extension is provided to allow
editors to just enter the commands required to generate the
diagrams. Two interfaces are provided: an OO Javascript API and a
textual DSL in the form of a UML profile for ADL, the Application
Definition Language.

UMLCanvas is a project by TheSoftwareFactory, 
maintained by Christophe VG <xtof@thesoftwarefactory.be>
