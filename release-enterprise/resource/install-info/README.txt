Dipforge Enterprise
===================

Is an all in one middleware platform, that specialises in Enterprise RAD(Rapid Application Development), we make enterprise development quick and easy. We do this by enabling collaborative web based development, enterprise wide Canonical models, and a simple enterprise development pattern. 

Dipforge is also quick and easy to install and provides a WebIDE, this means once installation is complete either in a public or private cloud, development for you and your team can start immediately. No need to setup complex environments on developer machines, or maintain them, simply point your browser at Dipforge and start working. Changes made via the Web IDE are visible immediately, no complex compile cycles, simply write and test.

The Enterprise RAD framework provided by Dipforge is implemented using a Model Driven approach that is coupled with an ESB(Enterprise Service Bus). This means that all changes to the data Model information are pushed through the ESB, dramatical simplify integration and interoperability between systems. Because of this approach it is very simply to implement an Enterprise Canonical Model using Dipforge, and as the system is dynamic, changes to the model are none braking and can be made at any stage.

Dipforge runs seamlessly in a micro service environment thus enabling a fully redundant and scalable environment.
